We educate and counsel tenants about their rights to fair and affordable housing and launch investigations against predatory real estate companies. HRIâ€™s data-driven model identifies properties where there is a high probability of systematic fraud and discrimination. We educate tenants about their rights to fair and affordable housing, launch investigations, and generate class action lawsuits against predatory real estate companies. Through a legal mobilization effort, HRI lays the foundation for tenants who have been defrauded or discriminated against by the real estate industry, to seek redress and secure their rights under the law."</p>

It is our goal that you walk away from this exhibit with an understanding of how widespread the issue is accross different neighborhoods within the 5 boroughs.  If you would like to make your voice heard, email your representative and make sure that your vote at the next election goes for someone that is willing to take housing discrimination seriously.  The laws are already in place, but enforcement is the key to ending this discriminatory practice.</p>
